            <h2>AC/DC</h2>
            <p>AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born brothers Malcolm (rhythm
                guitar) and Angus Young (lead guitar). Their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues
                rock, and heavy metal, but the band calls it simply "rock and roll".</p>
